# GRID3 Hackathon

[eHealth Africa](https://www.ehealthafrica.org/) in partnership with [CoLab](http://colab.com.ng/) presents [KadHack2018](https://bit.ly/kadhack2018) which aims to bring together tech professionals, software developers, UI/UX designers, data engineers and data analysts to create innovative solutions to interesting problems. 

The hackathon presents an opportunity for stakeholders in the tech sector to engage the Kaduna state government in order to come up with software prototypes that could be developed further to solve problems within the *Education* and *Health* sectors.
