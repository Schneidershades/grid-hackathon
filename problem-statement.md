# KadHack2018 Problem Statement

## Background

The problem statements for the KadHack2018 were compiled across two sectors in the state - Education and Health. Among other sources, a brainstorming session was organized by the KDBS with key stakeholders in the sectors who explored technology related challenges bedevilling them.

Overall, there is insufficient technical data-driven systems/platforms to fully achieve the sustainable social development goals in Kaduna State.

## Education Sector

* The educational sector has insufficient record or database to measure, analyze and evaluate the impact of dropout rates of students from schools at both primary and secondary levels
* The policymakers do not have sufficient, basic and accurate information for decision making and to also address some of the challenges/needs of the schools at both private and public schools
* Quality assurance checks are not being conducted quarterly, which sometimes are attributed to lack of funds. However, where these checks are conducted, no evidence to show either by the supervisors or the schools of the last visit, report and the location of the supervision
* The problem of data sharing has increased over time between private and public schools and the authority
* The Federal Ministry of Education stated that 10.5m children are out of school in Nigeria with 69% in the Northern region. There is a major need for an innovative strategy that will bring back these children, e.g. school feeding brought back a lot of children in Kaduna state, Basic Education Service Delivery for all (a World Bank Program), among others.

## Health Sector

* Integrated Supportive Supervision in health has faced a setback in recent times due to ineffective monitoring tool to track progress and tackle challenges at the health facilities. The supervision is meant to happen four times a month, but the system lacks an app/innovative tool for real-time monitoring. Mobile SMS system is in place but doesnâ€™t address the issue and is not analytical
* There is no system that manages the number of drugs consumed across all the health facilities in the state at all levels - tertiary, secondary and primary. However, there is an ongoing supply chain transformation project (but do not have consumption pattern for the HFs, reporting rate, etc.), it only compiles the data without trend pattern
* Health facilities fail to identify hard to reach areas which in most cases are from the hamlet areas for special intervention e.g. outreach services, health camps, etc. A dashboard needs to be developed to define these areas
* An up to date information management system that captures the estimated number of patients to health facilities and certain ailments in the state from a button is a challenge at the Ministry of Health
* Strengthen data visibility at the ministry level (need to know how many drugs, equipment, etc goes to which health facility and as at when) which will ensure proper monitoring and accountability. The same problem applies to the Ministry of Education and SUBEB of the number of items/teaching aids distributed to the schools. They need a system to be developed for entering such information at the health facility/school level to be visible in real time at the ministerial level
* The Insurance Scheme lacks a technology-based system for the database of all the enrollees, to monitor the insurance services pertaining to health
* A system needs to be developed to address the absenteeism of staff from workstations in the Education and Health sectors
* Non-coordination/non-reporting of sanitary inspection of residential houses, markets and health education on personal hygiene
* No mechanism in place at which street food vendors are being inspected regularly to ensure compliance with the national policy on food safety and hygiene
* There isn't a system at which management meetings are being coordinated, monitored and implemented at the State, LGA and ward levels to respond to health emergencies and no evidence to present where such meetings occurred
